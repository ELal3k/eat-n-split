## Overview
Split the Bill is a React application that allows friends to track and manage shared expenses in a user-friendly manner.
This app is a React challenge from the [Jonas Schmedtmann's](https://codingheroes.io/) course in Udemy.
It was very helpful for me  to clarify further the concepts about state management and its  best practices!
